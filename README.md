# Emulation-of-CPU
The project consisted of many phases.In this project we had to code the functionalities and the model of CPU with all its vital components. We had created our own assembly rules and code for our CPU. We did code the entire project in "C".  The initial phase consisted of created all the registers, ALU ,control unit and all the flags required. Later we designed the arithmetic unit and the logic. Later the controls and the loop we designed which work for the assembly function we wrote.By the end of all phase the CPU could compute basic functionalities.   
Developed assembly code for the designed emulator.Designed control structures and the looping structures for customized assembly code.
